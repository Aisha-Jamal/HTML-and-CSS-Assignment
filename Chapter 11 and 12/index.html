    </ul>
    <h3 class="headings" id="cnc"><span>C</span>loud Native Computing:</h3>
    <p>The <span class="bold">Cloud Native Computing</span> program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like,
        <span class="emphasis">Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</span> whille introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>

    <h3 class="headings" id="ai"><span>A</span>rtificial Intelligence:</h3>
    <p>The <span class="bold">artificial intelligence</span> program of PIAIC takes the students through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <span class="emphasis">Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</span>        and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.</p>

    <h3 class="headings" id="bcc"><span>B</span>lockchain:</h3>
    <p>The main emphasis of <span class="bold">Blockchain</span> program is to understand the blockchains like <span class="emphasis">Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</span> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like
        Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an initial Coin Offering (ICO)
        of a crypto-token.</p>

    <h3 class="headings" id="iot"><span>I</span>nternet of Things:</h3>
    <p>The <span class="bold">Internet of things</span> program introduces the students to open source development technologies like <span class="emphasis">Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</span> while making
        them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.</p>
